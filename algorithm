semaphore: Chopstick -> S
when philosopher grab the Chopstick -> excute operation wait() or P(S)
when philosopher release the Chopstick -> excute operation signal() or V(S)

we're gonna use array of Chopstick -> Chopstick[5]
variable i will be initialized 0 -> 4
below this text you will find explination what will philosopher do
when he want to eat or leave

do
{
if Chopstick is available
	wait(Chopstick[i])
	wait(Chopstick[(i + 1) % 5])
	// start eating
	signal(Chopstick[i])
	signal(Chopstick[(i + 1) % 5])
	//leave
} while(true)
